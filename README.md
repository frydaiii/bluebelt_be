## Introduction
This document outlines the design of a client-server communication system where the client can initialize and disable connections, exchange text messages with the server, and maintain a heart-beating connection to ensure the connection is alive.

## Requirements
1. Client Features:
    - Initialize connection to the server
    - Disable connection from the server
    - Send and receive text messages
    - Maintain an active connection through heart-beating

2. Server Features:
    - Accept connections from multiple clients
    - Receive and send text messages to clients
    - Respond to heart-beat signals from clients

3. Communication:
    - Text-based messaging between client and server
    - Heart-beating mechanism to monitor connection status

## System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture where multiple clients can communicate with a central server. The communication will be facilitated over TCP/IP for reliable transmission.

## Components

### Client
- Connection Initialization: Establish a connection to the server.
- Connection Termination: Disconnect from the server.
- Messaging: Send and receive text messages.
- Heart-Beat Mechanism: Periodically send heart-beat signals to the server to check connection status.

### Server
- Connection Handling: Accept connections from clients.
- Messaging: Send and receive text messages.
- Heart-Beat Response: Respond to heart-beat signals from clients to indicate active connection.

## Communication Protocol

### Message Format
- Text Message: { "type": "message", "content": "Hello, World!" }
- Heart-Beat: { "type": "heartbeat" }
- Connection Init/Terminate:
  - Init: { "type": "init" }
  - Terminate: { "type": "terminate" }

### Port
- The server will listen on a specified TCP port (e.g., 12345).

## Heart-Beating Mechanism
- Client: Sends a heart-beat signal every 30 seconds.
- Server: Responds to the heart-beat signal to confirm the connection is still active.
- Timeout: If no heart-beat is received within 60 seconds, the server will assume the client is disconnected.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Connection Initialization
```
Client                     Server
  |                           |
  |---- Init Connection ----->|
  |                           |
  |<--- Connection Ack -------|
  |                           |
```
### Messaging
```
Client                     Server
  |                           |
  |--- Send Text Message ---->|
  |                           |
  |<--- Receive Message ------|
  |                           |
```
### Heart-Beating
```
Client                     Server
  |                           |
  |--- Heart-Beat Signal ---->|
  |                           |
  |<--- Heart-Beat Ack -------|
  |                           |
```
### Connection Termination
```
Client                     Server
  |                           |
  |-- Terminate Connection -->|
  |                           |
  |<--- Termination Ack ------|
  |                           |
```
## Error Handling and Recovery
- Connection Loss: The client and server should handle unexpected disconnections gracefully and attempt reconnection.
- Invalid Messages: The ser
